# MegaveAPI
First of all, before creating a JSON object as the question suggests, I tried a simple API request function, for calling it when it be were useful for requesting HTTP methods. Then, I created the JSON objects and passed them as the first parameter of the PostRequest function, as the second parameter the correct URL coping that from API documentation, and as the third parameter the header.
Same as the post function, I created the get function passing into it only the URL and the JSON client parameter, which allows me to request specific data.
after getting all the JSON objects that match the requirements of the SalesOrderUpdate objects, I post in the SalesOrderUpdate URL the object created.
